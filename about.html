                    Hey! My name is Matthew, I am 16 years old, live in the Netherlands, and I am a student at MediaCollege Amsterdam.<br>
                    I live at 2 families, at my father during the weekdays and at my mother during the weekends.<br>
                    I have my own computer setup at both families and have my own room.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to game alot, primarily ROBLOX but also some Counter Strike 2 along the side.<br>
                    For ROBLOX I primarily play surf but also some other games from time to time<br>
                    For Counter Strike 2 I usually do Arms Race, but also some standard gamemodes<br>

                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>
                    In my free time if I have nothing else to do, I usually like to do some programming.<br>
                    Either on my autoclicker to improve it, or on some random projects.<br>
                    I also watch YouTube along the side or talk with my friends, which is relatively easy to do if you have 3 monitors
                    to work with.<br>
                    I also work on the game of which I am a developer of if something is requested to be added.<br>
                    During free time I have actually made a lot of utility items for QOL of daily usage of my computer.<br>
                    Such as a tool to instantly screenshot the monitor the mouse is over for if you need to take a quick screenshot.<br>
                    Or a tool to start a self-hosted
